# McDonalds Order Queue System
This is the solution I wrote for an Assignment I made as a TA for students of an Object-Oriented C++ course at LUMS. 
It uses Linked Lists to implement Queues and 2D Arrays for storing orders.
There are composition relationships between Classes and data flow between them.
